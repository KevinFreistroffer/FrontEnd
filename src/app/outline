So it's going to be the standard header, main footer setup with whatever tiles or a large picture thing or something interesting, in the middle, and then
i'll think of the usual login, register, dashboard and then i'll dig into forms, and then i'll get sorta stuck on the details, and then sorta want to do the google auth thingand sorta get stuck on it and
and give up on it and so instead maybe just a single page with some interesting CSS things, just to show off my skills, and a table with infinite data I guess is the challenge.
